  <h2>
    Basic Rules
  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
     The goal of the game is to lower your enemies health points to zero. You will draw a card each turn and your total mana points will increase by one to help you with playing those cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      As can be seen in the picture below the number represented by red is your health points, the number represented by white is the number of cards that are left in your deck and the number represented inside the blue square is your mana points.
    </p>

      You can see what a card looks like below, the cards have defense and attack points. They also have a cost value which is deducted from your total mana when you play them. If you don't have enough mana to play a card, well... you are going to have to wait until you have enough mana.
    </p>

  <h2>
    Playing A Card
  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
      To play a card you have to drag a card with a cost less than your mana points and drop it to the table.
    </p>

  <h2>

  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
      When it is your turn the red button on the right will glow bright and you will be able to click on it. If you are finished playing, press the end turn button to pass the turn to the enemy player.

  <h2>
    Attacking An Enemy Card
  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
      Attacking an enemy card is usefull if you want to control the board and if you are unhappy about the existance of an enemy card (who isn't?). To Attack an enemy card drag a card on your side of the board and drop it on the enemy card. If the enemy card has higher defense points than your card, your card will die. If you card has higher defense points than the enemy card, the enemy card will die. If both card cards have equal defense points, then both cards will die.
    </p>

  <h2>
    Attacking The Enemy Head
  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
      As mentioned before, to win the game; well... you are going to have to attack the enemy head. This way you can lower their health points to zero. It is simple, just drag your card and drop it on the X.
    </p>

  <h2>
    Making Decks
  </h2>
  <div class="foreground">
    <p>
      Each time you win a game, you will also earn a card. You can use these cards to make a better deck. In the deck maker, the cards that are marked white are the cards that are in your deck, you can click on them to remove them from your deck. The cards that are marked red though, are not in your deck. You can click on them to add them to your deck. A deck consists of 40 cards, click on submit deck to save your deck. If there aren't 40 cards in your deck, it won't be submitted.
